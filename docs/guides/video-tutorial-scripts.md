## Getting Started with Flashcards

**Duration**: 5 minutes  
**Goal**: Help new users create their first flashcards  
**Prerequisites**: User has an account and basic curriculum setup

### Script

**[0:00 - 0:15] Introduction**

> "Hi! I'm excited to show you how to create your first flashcards in our learning app. Flashcards are a powerful way to help your kids memorize facts, vocabulary, and key concepts. By the end of this video, you'll know how to create different types of flashcards and get them into your review system. Let's get started!"

**[0:15 - 0:45] Navigation**

> "First, let's navigate to where we create flashcards. I'm going to click on one of my subjects - let's use 'Science' here. Then I'll click on a unit - 'Solar System.' 
> 
> Notice at the bottom of the unit page, there's a section called 'Flashcards' with a count showing how many we have. Since this is new, it shows zero. Let's change that!"

**[0:45 - 1:30] Creating First Flashcard**

> "I'll click the 'Add Flashcard' button, and this opens our flashcard creation modal. 
>
> Let's start with the simplest type - a basic question and answer card. The card type is already set to 'Basic' which is perfect.
>
> For the question, I'll type: 'What is the largest planet in our solar system?'
>
> For the answer: 'Jupiter'
>
> I can add a hint to help kids remember - I'll type: 'Think about the Roman king of the gods'
>
> The difficulty is set to 'Medium' which seems right for this question.
>
> I'll add some tags to organize this card: 'planets' and 'solar-system'
>
> Now I'll click 'Save' and watch our first flashcard appear in the list!"

**[1:30 - 2:15] Creating Multiple Choice Card**

> "Let's create a multiple choice question. I'll click 'Add Flashcard' again.
>
> This time, I'll change the card type to 'Multiple Choice.' Notice how the form changes to give us choice options.
>
> Question: 'Which planets are called gas giants?'
>
> Now I need to add choices. I'll click 'Add Choice' for each option:
> - Jupiter
> - Saturn 
> - Mars
> - Venus
>
> For this question, both Jupiter and Saturn are correct, so I'll check boxes 0 and 1.
>
> Hint: 'These planets are mostly made of gas, not rock'
>
> I'll set this as 'Hard' difficulty and add tags: 'planets', 'gas-giants'
>
> Save, and there's our multiple choice card!"

**[2:15 - 3:00] Testing in Review**

> "Now let's see these cards in action! I'll scroll up and click 'Start Review' for this unit.
>
> Here's our first card - 'What is the largest planet?' The interface shows the question clearly with a 'Show Answer' button. This is what your kids will see.
>
> Click 'Show Answer' - there's Jupiter! Now I can rate how easy this was. I'll click 'Good' since it's a straightforward fact.
>
> Next card - our multiple choice question. The interface shows all four options with checkboxes. I'll select Jupiter and Saturn... Perfect! It shows I got it right and I can rate the difficulty."

**[3:00 - 3:45] Organization Tips**

> "Before we finish, let me show you a few organization tips. Back in the flashcard list, notice we can:
>
> - Filter by card type - see just multiple choice or just basic cards
> - Filter by difficulty - focus on hard cards for extra practice  
> - Search for specific content - I'll search for 'Jupiter' and see both cards
> - Use tags to group related concepts
>
> You can also see when each card was created and easily edit or delete cards by clicking the action buttons."

**[3:45 - 4:30] Quick Demo of Other Features**

> "There are lots more features we'll cover in other videos:
>
> - Import cards from Quizlet or Anki - great for existing study sets
> - Print flashcards as PDFs for offline study
> - Bulk operations for managing lots of cards
> - Different card types like fill-in-the-blank
>
> But you now have everything you need to start creating effective flashcards for your curriculum!"

**[4:30 - 5:00] Wrap-up**

> "That's it! You've created your first flashcards and seen how they work in the review system. The key is to start small - create 5-10 cards for a topic, test them out, then build your collection over time.
>
> Remember: good flashcards have clear questions, specific answers, and helpful hints for kids mode. In our next video, we'll explore all the different card types available. Thanks for watching!"

## Creating Different Card Types

**Duration**: 7 minutes  
**Goal**: Demonstrate all 6 card types with practical examples  
**Prerequisites**: Basic flashcard creation knowledge

### Script

**[0:00 - 0:20] Introduction**

> "Welcome back! In this video, I'll show you all six types of flashcards you can create, and when to use each one. Different card types help students learn in different ways, so having variety in your flashcard collection is really powerful. Let's explore each type with practical examples."

**[0:20 - 1:00] Basic Cards (Review)**

> "We covered basic cards in the last video, but let me quickly review. Basic cards are your traditional question and answer format - perfect for definitions, facts, and simple concepts.
>
> Example: 'What does 'photosynthesis' mean?' → 'The process plants use to make food from sunlight'
>
> Use basic cards for: vocabulary, historical dates, mathematical formulas, and factual recall."

**[1:00 - 2:00] Multiple Choice Cards**

> "Multiple choice cards are fantastic for concept recognition and testing understanding. Let me create one for a math concept.
>
> I'll set the card type to 'Multiple Choice' and ask: 'Which operations follow the order of operations first?'
>
> Choices:
> - Addition and Subtraction
> - Multiplication and Division  
> - Parentheses and Exponents
> - All operations are equal
>
> The correct answers are 'Parentheses and Exponents' - that's choice 2, so I'll check that box.
>
> Multiple choice is great for: science concepts, reading comprehension, and when you want to test recognition vs pure recall."

**[2:00 - 3:00] True/False Cards**

> "True/False cards are perfect for quick concept checks. Let me create one for history:
>
> I'll change to 'True/False' type. Notice it automatically creates two choices: True and False.
>
> Question: 'The American Civil War ended in 1865'
>
> This is true, so I'll select choice 0 (True).
>
> True/False cards work well for: fact verification, concept understanding, and quick review sessions. Kids can move through these quickly, which is great for confidence building."

**[3:00 - 4:15] Cloze Deletion (Fill-in-the-blank)**

> "Now for something really powerful - cloze deletion cards. These are fill-in-the-blank questions that help with context-based learning.
>
> I'll change the card type to 'Cloze' and you'll see the form changes completely.
>
> In the cloze text field, I'll type: 'During {{photosynthesis}}, plants use {{sunlight}} and {{carbon dioxide}} to make {{glucose}} and release {{oxygen}}'
>
> Notice I put double curly braces around the words I want to become blanks. The system automatically detects these and creates answer fields.
>
> In the answers array, it shows: photosynthesis, sunlight, carbon dioxide, glucose, oxygen
>
> When students review this, they'll see: 'During _____, plants use _____ and _____ to make _____ and release _____'
>
> This is excellent for: scientific processes, language learning, historical sequences, and anything where context matters."

**[4:15 - 5:15] Typed Answer Cards**

> "Typed answer cards require students to spell answers exactly - perfect for vocabulary and spelling practice.
>
> I'll switch to 'Typed Answer' and create a spelling challenge:
>
> Question: 'Spell the word meaning "the study of living things"'
> Answer: 'biology'
>
> When reviewing, students must type 'b-i-o-l-o-g-y' exactly. The system checks spelling automatically.
>
> Use typed answer cards for: spelling practice, vocabulary precision, mathematical expressions, and foreign language learning."

**[5:15 - 6:00] Image Occlusion (Preview)**

> "Our final card type is Image Occlusion - this is incredibly powerful for visual learning, though it's in development.
>
> With image occlusion, you upload a diagram or image, then mark areas to hide. Students see the image with certain parts covered and must identify what's hidden.
>
> Perfect for: anatomy diagrams, geographical maps, mathematical graphs, and any visual learning where students need to identify parts of a whole.
>
> This feature is coming soon, and we'll have a dedicated video when it's ready!"

**[6:00 - 6:45] Choosing the Right Card Type**

> "So when should you use each type? Here's my quick guide:
>
> - **Basic**: Facts, definitions, simple Q&A
> - **Multiple Choice**: Concept recognition, testing understanding  
> - **True/False**: Quick fact checks, confidence building
> - **Cloze**: Processes, sequences, context-based learning
> - **Typed Answer**: Spelling, precision, vocabulary building
> - **Image Occlusion**: Visual identification, anatomy, geography
>
> Mix different types in your units for variety and engagement!"

**[6:45 - 7:00] Wrap-up**

> "That's all six card types! Start with basic and multiple choice, then experiment with cloze deletion as you get comfortable. Remember, variety keeps students engaged and helps different learning styles. In our next video, we'll cover importing cards from Quizlet and Anki. See you there!"

## Importing from Quizlet and Anki

**Duration**: 6 minutes  
**Goal**: Show users how to import existing flashcard collections  
**Prerequisites**: Understanding of basic flashcard creation

### Script

**[0:00 - 0:15] Introduction**

> "One of the most powerful features of our flashcard system is the ability to import cards from other platforms. If you've been using Quizlet or Anki, you don't have to start over! In this video, I'll show you how to bring your existing collections into our system and enhance them with our features."

**[0:15 - 0:45] Import Overview**

> "We support importing from several sources:
> - Quizlet study sets (copy/paste or file upload)
> - Anki decks (full .apkg packages with media)
> - CSV files from spreadsheets
> - Other formats like Mnemosyne
>
> Each import method preserves your hard work while giving you access to our family-friendly features, integrated reviews, and curriculum organization."

**[0:45 - 2:00] Quizlet Import - Copy/Paste Method**

> "Let's start with Quizlet since it's so popular. I have a Quizlet study set about the American Revolution. 
>
> First, I'll go to Quizlet and open my study set. I'll click 'Export' then 'Copy text' - this copies all the cards in a tab-separated format.
>
> Now back in our app, I'll click 'Import Flashcards' in my unit. I'll select the 'Copy/Paste' method and paste the text into the text area.
>
> Watch this - I'll click 'Preview' and the system automatically detects the tab-separated format and shows me how the cards will import. I can see 15 cards detected, all valid, with questions and answers properly separated.
>
> The preview shows each card with its detected type - all basic cards in this case. I can review and make changes if needed.
>
> I'll click 'Import' and... done! All 15 cards are now in my unit and available for review."

**[2:00 - 3:15] Anki Import - Full Package**

> "Anki imports are even more impressive because they preserve everything - card types, media files, tags, and more.
>
> I have an Anki deck about Spanish vocabulary with audio pronunciations. In Anki, I'll go to File → Export, select my deck, and make sure to include media files. This creates an .apkg file.
>
> Back in our app, I'll start a new import, but this time I'll choose 'File Upload' and select my .apkg file.
>
> The system automatically detects this as an Anki package. Click 'Preview' and wow - look at all this preserved data! It detected multiple card types, imported the audio files, kept all the tags, and even preserved the scheduling information.
>
> This Spanish deck has basic cards, cloze deletion for grammar, and typed answer cards for spelling practice. All the audio files are working perfectly.
>
> I'll import this and now I have a rich, multimedia flashcard collection ready for family use!"

**[3:15 - 4:00] Handling Import Issues**

> "Sometimes imports need a little help. Let me show you common issues and fixes.
>
> Here's a problematic CSV file - when I preview it, I see some validation errors. Row 3 is missing an answer, and Row 7 has formatting issues.
>
> The preview clearly shows these problems with red highlighting. I can either:
> 1. Fix the source data and re-import
> 2. Skip the problem rows and import the good ones
> 3. Edit the data right in the preview
>
> I'll choose to skip the problem rows. The import completes successfully with 8 out of 10 cards imported, and I get a detailed report of what happened."

**[4:00 - 5:00] Enhancing Imported Cards**

> "Once cards are imported, you can enhance them with our features. Let me show you how to improve a basic Quizlet import.
>
> I'll edit one of the imported cards. I can:
> - Add hints for kids mode
> - Change basic cards to multiple choice for variety
> - Add tags for better organization
> - Adjust difficulty levels
> - Include images or media
>
> For example, this card about the Boston Tea Party was just basic Q&A. I'll convert it to multiple choice by changing the card type and adding some plausible wrong answers. Now it's more engaging for students!"

**[5:00 - 5:45] Best Practices**

> "Here are my top tips for importing:
>
> 1. **Start small** - import 10-20 cards first to test the process
> 2. **Clean your data** - fix obvious errors before importing  
> 3. **Preview everything** - always check the preview before final import
> 4. **Organize immediately** - add tags and set difficulty levels
> 5. **Test in review** - make sure cards work properly in our system
> 6. **Enhance gradually** - improve cards over time with hints, images, and variety
>
> Remember, importing is just the beginning - the real power comes from organizing these cards within your curriculum and using our family-friendly review system."

**[5:45 - 6:00] Wrap-up**

> "That's importing in action! Whether you're coming from Quizlet, Anki, or another platform, you can bring your cards with you and make them even better. In our next video, we'll explore how to use the review system effectively for spaced repetition learning. Thanks for watching!"

## Using the Review System

**Duration**: 4 minutes  
**Goal**: Show how flashcards integrate with spaced repetition  
**Prerequisites**: Familiarity with creating/importing flashcards

### Script

**[0:00 - 0:15] Introduction**

> "Now that you have flashcards in your system, let's see how they work with our intelligent review system. This isn't just random practice - it's spaced repetition that adapts to how well your student knows each card. This is where the real learning magic happens!"

**[0:15 - 0:45] Starting a Review Session**

> "I'm going to start a review session for my Science unit. I'll click 'Start Review' and the system automatically selects cards that need practice today.
>
> Notice it's mixing flashcards with other review items like topics and sessions - this integrated approach helps reinforce learning across all materials.
>
> The system shows me 12 items to review today, including 8 flashcards. Let's see how different card types appear in review."

**[0:45 - 1:30] Basic Card Review**

> "Here's a basic card: 'What is the largest planet in our solar system?'
>
> The student sees just the question first. They think about the answer, then click 'Show Answer' to reveal 'Jupiter.' 
>
> Now comes the key part - rating the difficulty. The options are:
> - **Again** (0-1 day): I got it wrong or struggled
> - **Hard** (2-3 days): I got it right but it was difficult  
> - **Good** (4-7 days): I got it right with normal effort
> - **Easy** (8-15 days): I knew it immediately
>
> I'll click 'Good' since this was a straightforward recall. The system schedules this card to appear again in about a week."

**[1:30 - 2:15] Multiple Choice Review**

> "Next up - a multiple choice card: 'Which planets are gas giants?'
>
> The interface shows all options with checkboxes. I need to select Jupiter and Saturn... correct! 
>
> The system immediately shows feedback - green checkmarks for correct choices. Then I rate the difficulty. Even though the system checked my answer, I still rate how confident I felt.
>
> Multiple choice cards that you get wrong don't offer the full difficulty scale - they come back sooner for more practice."

**[2:15 - 3:00] Cloze Deletion Review**

> "Here's a cloze card: 'During _____, plants use _____ and _____ to make _____ and release _____.'
>
> I need to type each answer. The system checks spelling as I go - notice the green checkmarks appearing as I type correct answers.
>
> If I misspell something, it highlights in red and gives me another chance. This builds both understanding and spelling accuracy.
>
> Once all blanks are filled correctly, I rate the overall difficulty."

**[3:00 - 3:30] Kids Mode Features**

> "Let me show you how this looks in Kids Mode. I'll switch modes... 
>
> Notice the interface is more colorful and encouraging. The hint button is more prominent, and when students rate difficulty, they see friendly faces instead of formal terms:
> - 😅 'That was tricky!' (Again)
> - 😐 'I had to think hard' (Hard)
> - 😊 'I got it!' (Good) 
> - 😄 'That was easy!' (Easy)
>
> This makes the rating process more intuitive for younger learners."

**[3:30 - 3:50] Review Analytics**

> "After completing a review session, students see their progress. The system shows:
> - Cards reviewed today
> - Accuracy percentage
> - Time spent studying
> - Cards mastered vs still learning
>
> Parents can see this data too, helping track progress without putting pressure on kids."

**[3:50 - 4:00] Wrap-up**

> "The review system turns your flashcards into a powerful learning tool that adapts to each student's pace. Cards they know well appear less often, while difficult concepts get more practice. This intelligent spacing is proven to improve long-term retention. Next up, we'll cover printing flashcards for offline study!"

## Advanced Features Demo

**Duration**: 8 minutes  
**Goal**: Showcase power-user features for efficient flashcard management  
**Prerequisites**: Comfort with basic flashcard operations

### Script

**[0:00 - 0:20] Introduction**

> "Ready to become a flashcard power user? In this video, I'll show you advanced features that make managing large collections a breeze. We'll cover search and filtering, bulk operations, import/export options, performance tools, and organization strategies. Let's dive into the advanced toolkit!"

**[0:20 - 1:15] Advanced Search and Filtering**

> "First, let's explore the search system. I have over 200 flashcards across multiple units, so finding specific cards is crucial.
>
> In the search box, I'll type 'photosynthesis' - instantly, it shows all cards mentioning this term, highlighting the matches.
>
> But there's more. I'll click 'Advanced Search' to access powerful filters:
> - Card type (show only multiple choice)
> - Difficulty level (focus on hard cards)
> - Date range (cards created this week)
> - Tag combinations (science AND biology)
> - Performance data (cards with low accuracy)
>
> Let me find all multiple choice science cards created this month that students find difficult. I'll set these filters... and there are 8 cards that match. This helps me identify content that needs attention."

**[1:15 - 2:00] Bulk Operations**

> "When you have lots of cards, bulk operations save huge amounts of time. Let me select multiple cards using the checkboxes.
>
> I'll select these 10 cards about planets and click 'Bulk Actions.' Look at these options:
> - Change difficulty level for all selected cards
> - Add tags to multiple cards at once
> - Activate or deactivate groups of cards
> - Export just the selected cards
> - Delete multiple cards (with confirmation)
>
> I'll add the tag 'review-needed' to all these cards since they're challenging concepts. One action, 10 cards updated!"

**[2:00 - 3:00] Smart Import Features**

> "Let's look at advanced import capabilities. I have a complex CSV file with mixed card types.
>
> When I upload it, the system doesn't just import blindly. Look at this preview:
> - Auto-detected card types based on content patterns
> - Duplicate detection comparing against existing cards
> - Data validation with specific error messages
> - Import statistics showing what will happen
>
> I can see 3 potential duplicates highlighted in yellow. The system suggests merge strategies:
> - Skip duplicates (keep existing)
> - Update existing cards with new data  
> - Create variations with different IDs
>
> I'll choose 'Update existing' to improve my current cards with this new data."

**[3:00 - 4:00] Export and Backup Options**

> "For data management, our export system is incredibly flexible. From the export menu, I can:
>
> **Export by scope**:
> - Single unit or entire curriculum
> - Selected cards only
> - Filtered results from searches
>
> **Multiple formats**:
> - Anki packages (full fidelity)
> - Quizlet text (for sharing)
> - CSV (for spreadsheet editing)
> - JSON (complete backup)
> - PDF (for printing)
>
> **Custom options**:
> - Include media files or not
> - Preserve metadata and statistics
> - Date ranges and filtering
>
> I'll create a complete backup in JSON format - this preserves everything and can be re-imported if needed."

**[4:00 - 5:00] Performance and Analytics**

> "The performance dashboard gives insight into your flashcard effectiveness. Click 'Analytics' to see:
>
> - Cards by type and difficulty distribution
> - Review success rates over time
> - Most challenging cards needing attention
> - Usage statistics for each unit
> - Import/export history
>
> This heat map shows which cards students struggle with most. Red indicates high failure rates - these cards need better hints or different approaches.
>
> The timeline shows review frequency - gaps indicate weeks without study, while peaks show intensive review periods."

**[5:00 - 6:00] Organization Strategies**

> "For large collections, organization is key. Here are advanced strategies:
>
> **Hierarchical tagging**: Instead of just 'math,' use 'math.algebra.equations' for precise categorization.
>
> **Difficulty progression**: Create easy → medium → hard sequences for concepts.
>
> **Cross-referencing**: Link related cards across units with consistent tagging.
>
> **Seasonal organization**: Tag cards for specific review periods or grade levels.
>
> I'll demonstrate by reorganizing this biology unit. I'll use bulk operations to apply consistent tags: 'bio.cells.organelles' for cellular biology, 'bio.plants.photosynthesis' for plant processes."

**[6:00 - 7:00] Duplicate Management**

> "Over time, you'll accumulate duplicates from various imports. The duplicate detection system helps clean these up.
>
> I'll run a duplicate scan on this unit. The system found 5 potential duplicates using fuzzy matching - it catches similar questions even with different wording.
>
> For each duplicate pair, I can:
> - Compare side-by-side to see differences
> - Merge the better elements from each
> - Keep one and delete the other
> - Mark as 'not duplicate' if they're actually different
>
> This pair looks identical except one has a hint. I'll merge them to keep the hint and delete the redundant card."

**[7:00 - 7:45] Performance Optimization**

> "For users with hundreds of cards, performance matters. Here are built-in optimizations:
>
> **Cache warming**: Pre-load frequently accessed cards for faster response.
>
> **Lazy loading**: Cards load as needed rather than all at once.
>
> **Search indexing**: Full-text search is lightning fast even with large collections.
>
> **Background processing**: Large imports and exports run in the background.
>
> You can manually warm the cache for a unit or clear it if you're experiencing slowdowns."

**[7:45 - 8:00] Wrap-up**

> "These advanced features turn our flashcard system into a sophisticated learning management tool. Start simple, then gradually incorporate these power-user features as your collection grows. The key is consistent organization and regular maintenance. In our next video, we'll see how all this looks from a child's perspective in Kids Mode!"

> Watch the transformation! The interface becomes more colorful, buttons are larger and easier to click, and the language becomes more encouraging and age-appropriate."

**[0:45 - 1:30] Kids-Friendly Interface**

> "Look at these differences:
>
> **Colors and design**: Bright, cheerful colors instead of business-like gray. Larger fonts that are easier to read.
>
> **Button labels**: Instead of 'Execute Import,' it says 'Add New Cards.' Instead of 'Difficulty Rating,' it shows emoji faces.
>
> **Encouraging language**: 'Great job!' instead of 'Correct.' 'Let's try again!' instead of 'Incorrect.'
>
> **Simplified navigation**: Only the essential features are visible - study, review, and help. Complex management tools are hidden.
>
> **Safety features**: Kids can't delete cards, change settings, or access parent tools."

**[1:30 - 2:30] Review Experience for Kids**

> "Let me start a review session as a child would see it.
>
> **Question presentation**: Clean, uncluttered layout focuses attention on the learning content.
>
> **Hint system**: The hint button is prominent and encouraging - 'Need a clue?' instead of just 'Hint.'
>
> **Answer feedback**: When I click 'Show Answer,' it appears with a gentle animation and positive reinforcement.
>
> **Difficulty rating**: Instead of formal terms, kids see:
> - 😅 'That was tricky!' 
> - 😐 'I had to think hard'
> - 😊 'I got it!'
> - 😄 'That was easy!'
>
> **Progress indicators**: Visual progress bars and celebration animations when completing sets."

**[2:30 - 3:15] Safety and Restrictions**

> "Kids Mode includes important safety restrictions:
>
> **No editing**: Children can't modify or delete flashcards. The 'Edit' and 'Delete' buttons simply don't appear.
>
> **No account access**: Can't change passwords, billing, or account settings.
>
> **Controlled navigation**: Can only access assigned units and subjects. Can't see other family members' work.
>
> **No external links**: Import/export features are hidden to prevent accidental data loss.
>
> **Session time limits**: Built-in breaks and study time recommendations.
>
> **Parent override**: The 'Parent Mode' button is always visible for quick access when help is needed."

**[3:15 - 3:45] Age-Appropriate Features**

> "Special features designed for different age groups:
>
> **Ages 5-8**: Extra-large buttons, simple vocabulary, lots of encouragement, automatic hints after wrong answers.
>
> **Ages 9-12**: More independence, progress tracking they can see, goal-setting features.
>
> **Teens**: Simplified interface but more advanced features like statistics and study scheduling.
>
> **Universal**: All ages get distraction-free studying, safe browsing, and parent oversight."

**[3:45 - 4:00] Wrap-up**

> "Kids Mode makes independent study safe and enjoyable. Children get the dignity of learning on their own while parents maintain complete control over content and settings. To exit Kids Mode, click 'Parent Mode' and enter your PIN. In our final video, we'll troubleshoot common issues and show you how to get help when you need it!"

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Duration**: 5 minutes  
**Goal**: Address the most frequent problems users encounter  
**Prerequisites**: Basic system usage

### Script

**[0:00 - 0:15] Introduction**

> "Even the best systems sometimes have hiccups! In this video, I'll walk through the most common issues users encounter and show you exactly how to fix them. Most problems have simple solutions, and I'll also show you how to get help when you need it."

**[0:15 - 1:00] Import Problems**

> "Let's start with import issues - the most common support requests.
>
> **Problem**: 'My Quizlet import says format not recognized.'
> **Solution**: The issue is usually formatting. Let me show you...
>
> I'll open this problematic Quizlet export. See the issue? It's using commas instead of tabs, and has inconsistent line breaks. 
>
> Quick fix: I'll manually specify the delimiter. In import options, I'll change from 'Auto-detect' to 'Comma' and try again. Perfect!
>
> **Problem**: 'Anki import failed with error message.'
> **Solution**: Usually file size. Large Anki decks (over 50MB) can timeout. Export smaller chunks from Anki, or try without media files first."

**[1:00 - 1:45] Review System Issues**

> "**Problem**: 'My flashcards aren't showing up in reviews.'
> 
> Let me check the common causes:
> 1. Are the cards active? I'll check the flashcard list - yes, they're active.
> 2. Is the unit assigned to the child? In the unit settings, I'll verify assignment - it is assigned.
> 3. Are there review filters? Ah! Here's the issue - the review settings are filtering out 'Easy' cards, and these cards are marked as easy.
>
> I'll change the filter to include all difficulty levels. Now let's test... perfect! The cards appear in the next review session.
>
> **Problem**: 'Reviews are too easy/too hard.'
> **Solution**: Adjust the difficulty ratings. Rate cards honestly - if something is too easy, mark it 'Easy' so it appears less often."

**[1:45 - 2:30] Performance Issues**

> "**Problem**: 'The app is running slowly.'
>
> First, I'll check the browser. Multiple tabs open, lots of extensions running - this can slow things down. Let me close unnecessary tabs.
>
> Next, I'll clear the cache. I'll press Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac) to force refresh the page. Much better!
>
> **Problem**: 'Large imports are timing out.'
> **Solution**: Break them into smaller chunks. Instead of importing 500 cards at once, try 100 at a time. The system processes smaller batches more reliably."

**[2:30 - 3:15] PDF and Print Problems**

> "**Problem**: 'PDF generation failed.'
>
> Usually this is too many cards selected. I was trying to print 200 cards at once - that's a lot! Let me select just 50 cards and try again... success!
>
> **Problem**: 'Print layout looks wrong.'
> **Solution**: Check your print settings. In the browser print dialog, make sure you select 'More settings' and set:
> - Scale: 100% (not 'Fit to page')
> - Margins: Minimum
> - Background graphics: On
>
> Let me show the difference - see how much better this looks with correct settings?"

**[3:15 - 4:00] Browser and Device Issues**

> "**Problem**: 'Features don't work on my phone.'
>
> Mobile browsers sometimes struggle with complex features. For the best experience:
> - Use Chrome or Safari on mobile
> - Update to the latest browser version  
> - For imports and complex operations, use a desktop browser
> - Clear browser cache if things seem broken
>
> **Problem**: 'Kids Mode button doesn't work.'
> **Solution**: This is usually JavaScript being blocked. Check your ad blocker settings - it might be too aggressive. I'll whitelist our domain in uBlock Origin... there, now it works perfectly."

**[4:00 - 4:30] Getting Help**

> "When you can't solve an issue yourself:
>
> **Built-in help**: Click the '?' button anywhere in the app for contextual help.
>
> **Documentation**: Visit our help center for detailed guides and tutorials.
>
> **Contact support**: Email support with:
> - What you were trying to do
> - What happened instead  
> - Your browser and device info
> - Screenshots if helpful
>
> **Community**: Join our Facebook group where other homeschool families share solutions."

**[4:30 - 5:00] Prevention Tips**

> "To prevent future issues:
>
> 1. **Keep browsers updated** - new versions fix bugs and improve performance
> 2. **Start small** - test new features with small datasets first
> 3. **Regular backups** - export your cards monthly as insurance
> 4. **Clean data** - fix formatting issues before importing
> 5. **Read error messages** - they usually tell you exactly what's wrong!
>
> Most problems have simple solutions. When in doubt, try the basics: refresh the page, clear cache, or try a different browser. Thanks for watching, and happy learning!"
