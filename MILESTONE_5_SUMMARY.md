# Milestone 5: Parent/Child Views - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented role-based parent and child interfaces for the homeschool learning app with configurable independence levels and one-click management actions.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Independence Level System (Child Model Enhanced)
- **4 Independence Levels**:
  - Level 1: Guided (View Only) - Child can only view scheduled sessions
  - Level 2: Basic (Reorder Tasks) - Child can reorder today's tasks
  - Level 3: Intermediate (Move Within Week) - Child can move sessions within the week
  - Level 4: Advanced (Plan Proposals) - Child can propose weekly plans for parent approval

### 2. Parent Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
**Key Features:**
- **Multi-child overview** with weekly progress tracking
- **Capacity monitoring** showing workload status (On Track, Behind, Overloaded)
- **Today's sessions display** (max 3 per child)
- **Review queue counts** for each child
- **Independence level management** with dropdown selectors
- **One-click actions**:
  - Bulk complete today's sessions
  - Skip day functionality (creates catch-up sessions)
  - Quick access to child's today view

**Visual Elements:**
- Color-coded capacity status indicators
- Weekly progress charts with daily completion rates
- Catch-up session alerts
- Quick action buttons

### 3. Child Today View (`/dashboard/child/{id}/today`)
**Kid-friendly Interface:**
- **Simplified layout** with large, clear elements
- **Max 3 planned sessions** for the day (as per requirements)
- **Review queue** (5-10 items max) with gamified presentation
- **Evidence capture prompts** after session completion (photos, voice memos, notes)
- **Progress celebration** with encouraging messages
- **Independence-based interactions**:
  - Level 2+: Drag-and-drop task reordering
  - Level 3+: Weekly view with session movement capability

### 4. Role-Based Middleware
- **ChildAccess Middleware**: Ensures users can only access their own children's data
- **Ownership verification** on all child-related operations
- **Automatic child object injection** into request attributes

### 5. One-Click Actions (Parent Tools)
- **Skip Day**: Automatically creates catch-up sessions with reason tracking
- **Move Theme**: Reschedule sessions to different weeks
- **Bulk Complete**: Mark all today's sessions as complete with evidence notes
- **Session Completion**: Individual session completion with progress tracking

### 6. Navigation Enhancements
- **Role-based navigation** in main menu
- **Child Views dropdown** showing each child's "Today" interface
- **Parent Dashboard** as primary landing page
- **Quick access patterns** for common parent/child workflows

## Technical Architecture

### Controllers
- **DashboardController**: Handles all parent/child dashboard functionality
- **Enhanced ChildController**: Added independence level management
- **Middleware Integration**: ChildAccess for secure child data access

### Models
- **Child Model Extensions**:
  - `independence_level` field (1-4)
  - Helper methods: `canReorderTasks()`, `canMoveSessionsInWeek()`, etc.
  - Level labels and capability checking

### Routes Structure
```
/dashboard (Parent Dashboard)
/dashboard/parent (Explicit parent view)
/dashboard/child/{id}/today (Child Today View)
/dashboard/sessions/{id}/complete (One-click completion)
/dashboard/bulk-complete-today (Bulk actions)
/dashboard/child/{id}/independence-level (Level management)
```

### Views Architecture
- **Parent Dashboard** (`resources/views/dashboard/parent.blade.php`):
  - Multi-child capacity overview
  - Weekly progress visualization
  - One-click action interfaces
- **Child Today View** (`resources/views/dashboard/child-today.blade.php`):
  - Kid-friendly design
  - Independence-based feature access
  - Evidence capture interface

## Database Schema Updates
Added to `children` table:
- `independence_level` (integer, default 1, range 1-4)

## Key User Flows

### Parent Flow:
1. Login → Parent Dashboard
2. View all children's daily progress and capacity status
3. One-click actions (complete sessions, skip days, adjust plans)
4. Access individual child's "Today" view for detailed oversight
5. Adjust independence levels as children mature

### Child Flow:
1. Access via Parent Dashboard → Child's Today view
2. View max 3 scheduled sessions with clear instructions
3. Complete sessions with evidence capture
4. Access review queue (5-10 items max)
5. Independence-based features:
   - Level 2+: Reorder today's tasks
   - Level 3+: Move sessions within the week

## Progressive Independence Implementation
- **Level 1 (View Only)**: Read-only access, parent maintains full control
- **Level 2 (Basic)**: Can reorder today's tasks via drag-and-drop
- **Level 3 (Intermediate)**: Can move sessions within the week
- **Level 4 (Advanced)**: Can propose weekly plans (foundation for future milestone)

## Integration Points
- **Seamless integration** with existing M1-M4 functionality
- **Maintains existing** Planning Board, Review System, and Calendar features
- **HTMX patterns** consistent with existing codebase
- **Supabase authentication** and data access patterns preserved

## Success Metrics Achieved
✅ **Role-based interfaces**: Distinct parent vs child experiences  
✅ **Independence levels**: 4-tier configurable autonomy system  
✅ **Today focus**: Simple daily view for children (max 3 sessions)  
✅ **Parent oversight**: Comprehensive monitoring with one-click actions  
✅ **Evidence capture**: Photo, voice, and note prompts after completion  
✅ **Progressive features**: Capabilities unlock based on independence level  

## File Structure
```
app/Http/Controllers/DashboardController.php - Main parent/child logic
app/Http/Middleware/ChildAccess.php - Role-based access control
app/Models/Child.php - Enhanced with independence levels
resources/views/dashboard/parent.blade.php - Parent overview
resources/views/dashboard/child-today.blade.php - Child daily interface
resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php - Updated navigation
routes/web.php - Dashboard routes with middleware
```

The implementation successfully delivers on all Milestone 5 requirements while maintaining the existing codebase patterns and providing a solid foundation for future enhancements.
